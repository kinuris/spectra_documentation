            <h2>4. Introduction</h2>
            <h3 id="section4_1">4.1 Project Context</h3>
            <p>The Spectre Clothing Management System operates within the fashion retail industry, specifically targeting small to medium-sized clothing boutiques. In today's competitive retail environment, clothing boutiques face significant challenges in managing their product catalogs, tracking inventory across multiple variants (sizes and colors), processing customer orders efficiently, and maintaining relationships with suppliers. Traditional manual processes, spreadsheet-based tracking, and disconnected systems lead to inventory discrepancies, delayed order processing, poor visibility into sales performance, and difficulty in making data-driven business decisions. Our web-based management system aims to address these operational inefficiencies by providing an integrated platform that centralizes all business operations.</p>
            <h3 id="section4_2">4.2 Importance of the Project</h3>
            <p>This system is crucial for modern retail operations as it transforms manual, error-prone processes into automated, reliable workflows. The significance lies in its ability to reduce operational costs, minimize human errors, improve customer satisfaction through faster order processing, and provide real-time business insights. For boutique owners and staff, the system eliminates the complexity of managing multiple spreadsheets and disparate systems, allowing them to focus on customer service and business growth. The role-based access control ensures that different staff members (Admin, Stock Manager, Sales Staff) can efficiently perform their specific duties while maintaining data security and operational oversight.</p>
            <h3 id="section4_3">4.3 Project Objectives</h3>
            <p>The project aims to achieve the following specific, measurable goals directly tied to addressing operational challenges in clothing boutique management:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>To develop a secure and intuitive web-based system that centralizes product catalog management, enabling efficient creation, updating, and organization of clothing items with their variants.</li>

            <h2>6. Back-end Development (Sir Joven's Subject)</h2>
            <h3 id="section6_1">6.1 Programming Language: Python with Django Framework</h3>
            <p>Python was selected as the primary backend programming language due to its readability, extensive libraries, and strong community support. The Django framework was chosen for its robust features, including an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), built-in admin panel, and security features, which accelerate development and ensure a scalable and maintainable application. Key libraries used include <code>Django</code> for the core framework, <code>mysqlclient</code> for MySQL database connectivity, <code>Pillow</code> for image handling, and <code>python-dotenv</code> for managing environment variables.</p>
            <h3 id="section6_2">6.2 Database: MySQL</h3>
            <p>MySQL is utilized as the relational database management system (RDBMS) for its reliability, performance, and widespread adoption. Django's ORM facilitates seamless interaction with the MySQL database, abstracting SQL queries and allowing developers to work with Python objects. The database schema is designed to support core functionalities such as user management, product catalog, inventory, orders, and supplier information. (Refer to ERD in Appendix 17.1 for detailed schema).</p>
            <h3 id="section6_3">6.3 Core Functions Implemented: Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)</h3>
            <p>The system implements comprehensive CRUD operations for all major entities. For example, administrators can create new product listings, users can read product details, inventory levels can be updated, and outdated supplier records can be deleted. These operations are handled through Django views, which process HTTP requests, interact with models (database tables), and return appropriate responses. Specific API endpoints are defined in Django's <code>urls.py</code> to manage these interactions.</p>
            <h3 id="section6_4">6.4 Core Functions Implemented: User Login & Logout</h3>
            <p>User authentication is managed using Django's built-in authentication system. This includes secure password hashing, user registration, login, and logout functionalities. Session management is handled by Django to maintain user state across requests, ensuring a secure and personalized experience. Role-based access control can be implemented to differentiate user permissions.</p>
            <h3 id="section6_5">6.5 Backend Architecture and Design Choices</h3>
            <p>The backend follows a Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, which is Django's variation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. This promotes separation of concerns, making the application modular and easier to maintain. The system is designed as a monolithic application, suitable for the project's scope. RESTful principles are applied for API design where applicable, ensuring predictable and standard-based communication with the frontend or other services. Security considerations include protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF, XSS) provided by Django, and secure handling of sensitive data.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="section7" class="section">
            <h2>7. Front-end Development (Sir Villy's Subject)</h2>
            <h3 id="section7_1">7.1 UI and Interactivity (JavaScript)</h3>
            <p>JavaScript is employed to enhance the user interface with dynamic and interactive elements. This includes client-side form validation to provide immediate feedback to users, asynchronous updates for parts of a page without full reloads (e.g., filtering product lists, updating shopping cart contents), and managing UI events to create a responsive user experience. While a specific complex JavaScript framework (like React or Vue) is not indicated for this project, vanilla JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM and interact with backend APIs for data retrieval and submission.</p>
            <h3 id="section7_2">7.2 UI Design (Tailwind CSS)</h3>
            <p>Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, is used for designing the user interface. This approach allows for rapid development and customization of styles directly within the HTML markup. Tailwind CSS facilitates the creation of a responsive design, ensuring the application is usable across various devices and screen sizes. Key design principles applied include a clean and intuitive layout, consistent styling for UI elements, and a focus on user experience. The <code>tailwind.config.js</code> and <code>postcss.config.js</code> files are configured to customize and process the Tailwind CSS build.</p>
            <h3 id="section7_3">7.3 Frontend Architecture and Design Choices</h3>
            <p>The frontend architecture is primarily a traditional multi-page application (MPA) where Django templates render HTML pages. JavaScript is used to add interactivity on these pages rather than building a full single-page application (SPA). The frontend communicates with the backend through standard HTTP requests for page navigation and form submissions, and potentially through asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX) calls to Django views that return JSON data for dynamic updates. This approach simplifies development for the given project scope while leveraging Django's templating engine and Tailwind CSS for efficient UI development.</p>
