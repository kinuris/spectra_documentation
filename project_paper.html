            <p>The system addresses critical problems in traditional clothing boutique operations by transforming manual, error-prone processes into automated, reliable workflows. (Expand with general area/industry and current challenges).</p>
            <h3 id="section8_2">1.2 Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>The web-based management system is designed to address the following specific problems for mock clients (Ms. Jeanny Escalada, Mr. Joven Alovera, Mr. Villy Delsocora): Manual inventory tracking using spreadsheets led to frequent stock discrepancies, overselling, and inability to identify slow-moving products. Order processing required multiple systems and phone calls, creating delays and customer dissatisfaction. Sales reporting was time-consuming and often incomplete, making business decision-making reactive rather than proactive. Supplier information was scattered across various documents, complicating procurement processes.</p>
            <h3 id="section8_3">1.3 Importance of the Project</h3>
            <p>This project is significant because it provides an integrated system with real-time inventory visibility and automatic low-stock alerts, preventing stockouts and enabling proactive reordering. Streamlined order processing reduces fulfillment time and improves customer satisfaction. Automated sales analytics and reporting enable data-driven decision-making with insights into product performance, customer trends, and seasonal patterns. Centralized supplier management facilitates better vendor relationships and procurement efficiency. The role-based access control ensures appropriate system usage while maintaining security and operational oversight, ultimately resulting in reduced operational costs, improved accuracy, enhanced customer service, and better business intelligence.

            <h3 id="section11_1">4.1 Back-end Development (Sir Joven's Subject)</h3>
            <h4 id="section11_1_1">4.1.1 Programming Language: Python</h4>
            <p>Python was selected as the primary backend programming language due to its readability, extensive libraries, and strong community support. The Django framework was chosen for its robust features, including an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), built-in admin panel, and security features, which accelerate development and ensure a scalable and maintainable application. Key libraries used include <code>mysqlclient</code> for MySQL database connectivity, <code>Pillow</code> for image handling, and <code>python-dotenv</code> for managing environment variables. (Expand on justification and specific roles of frameworks/libraries).</p>
            <h4 id="section11_1_2">4.1.2 Database: MySQL</h4>
            <p>MySQL is utilized as the relational database management system (RDBMS) for its reliability, performance, and widespread adoption. Django's ORM facilitates seamless interaction with the MySQL database, abstracting SQL queries and allowing developers to work with Python objects. The database schema is designed to support core functionalities such as user management, product catalog, inventory, orders, and supplier information. (Refer to ERD in Appendix C for detailed schema). (Expand on integration and schema description).</p>
            <h4 id="section11_1_3">4.1.3 Core Functions Implemented: Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD)</h4>
            <p>The system implements comprehensive CRUD operations for all major entities. For example, administrators can create new product listings, users can read product details, inventory levels can be updated, and outdated supplier records can be deleted. These operations are handled through Django views, which process HTTP requests, interact with models (database tables), and return appropriate responses. Specific API endpoints are defined in Django's <code>urls.py</code> to manage these interactions. (Provide concrete examples for key entities and detail backend logic, API endpoints, database interactions).</p>
            <h4 id="section11_1_4">4.1.4 Core Functions Implemented: User Login & Logout</h4>
            <p>User authentication is managed using Django's built-in authentication system. This includes secure password hashing, user registration, login, and logout functionalities. Session management is handled by Django to maintain user state across requests, ensuring a secure and personalized experience. Role-based access control can be implemented to differentiate user permissions. (Describe implementation, credential handling, session management, secure logout).</p>
            <h4 id="section11_1_5">4.1.5 Backend Architecture and Design Choices</h4>
            <p>The backend follows a Model-View-Template (MVT) architectural pattern, which is Django's variation of the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern. This promotes separation of concerns, making the application modular and easier to maintain. The system is designed as a monolithic application, suitable for the project's scope. RESTful principles are applied for API design where applicable, ensuring predictable and standard-based communication with the frontend or other services. Security considerations include protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., CSRF, XSS) provided by Django, and secure handling of sensitive data. (Discuss architectural pattern, design principles, security considerations).</p>

            <h3 id="section11_2">4.2 Front-end Development (Sir Villy's Subject)</h3>
            <h4 id="section11_2_1">4.2.1 UI and Interactivity (JavaScript)</h4>
            <p>JavaScript is employed to enhance the user interface with dynamic and interactive elements. This includes client-side form validation to provide immediate feedback to users, asynchronous updates for parts of a page without full reloads (e.g., filtering product lists, updating shopping cart contents), and managing UI events to create a responsive user experience. While a specific complex JavaScript framework (like React or Vue) is not indicated for this project, vanilla JavaScript is used to manipulate the DOM and interact with backend APIs for data retrieval and submission. (Provide specific examples of interactive elements).</p>
            <h4 id="section11_2_2">4.2.2 UI Design (Tailwind CSS)</h4>
            <p>Tailwind CSS, a utility-first CSS framework, is used for designing the user interface. This approach allows for rapid development and customization of styles directly within the HTML markup. Tailwind CSS facilitates the creation of a responsive design, ensuring the application is usable across various devices and screen sizes. Key design principles applied include a clean and intuitive layout, consistent styling for UI elements, and a focus on user experience. The <code>tailwind.config.js</code> and <code>postcss.config.js</code> files are configured to customize and process the Tailwind CSS build. (Discuss benefits and key design principles).</p>
            <h4 id="section11_2_3">4.2.3 Frontend Architecture and Design Choices</h4>
            <p>The frontend architecture is primarily a traditional multi-page application (MPA) where Django templates render HTML pages. JavaScript is used to add interactivity on these pages rather than building a full single-page application (SPA). The frontend communicates with the backend through standard HTTP requests for page navigation and form submissions, and potentially through asynchronous JavaScript (AJAX) calls to Django views that return JSON data for dynamic updates. This approach simplifies development for the given project scope while leveraging Django's templating engine and Tailwind CSS for efficient UI development. (Describe structure and communication with backend).</p>

            <h4 id="section11_4_1">4.4.1 Back-end Testing Strategies</h4>
            <p>The backend testing approach focused on ensuring reliable CRUD operations, data integrity, and proper authentication mechanisms. <strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Individual Django model methods and utility functions were tested using Django's built-in testing framework, including validation of model constraints, custom methods, and business logic. <strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Database connectivity and ORM operations were verified through test cases that create, read, update, and delete records across all models (Product, ProductVariant, Order, Customer, etc.). <strong>API Endpoint Testing:</strong> All Django views and URL patterns were tested to ensure proper HTTP responses, authentication requirements, and data handling. <strong>Authentication Testing:</strong> Role-based access control was validated by testing user permissions for different roles (Admin, Stock Manager, Sales Staff) across various system functions. <strong>Data Validation Testing:</strong> Form validations, model constraints, and business rules were tested to ensure data integrity, including SKU uniqueness, stock level validations, and order processing logic. (Mention testing frameworks/tools used, e.g., unittest, pytest).</p>
            <h4 id="section11_4_2">4.4.2 Front-end Testing Strategies</h4>
            <p>Frontend testing ensured a consistent, responsive, and intuitive user experience across different devices and browsers. <strong>UI/UX Testing:</strong> Manual testing of all user interfaces to verify proper layout, navigation flow, and visual consistency using Tailwind CSS components. <strong>Responsiveness Testing:</strong> The system was tested across multiple screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure responsive design functionality using Tailwind's responsive utilities. <strong>Browser Compatibility Testing:</strong> Cross-browser testing was conducted on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge to ensure consistent behavior and appearance. <strong>Form Validation Testing:</strong> Client-side and server-side form validations were tested for all input forms including product creation, order processing, and user authentication. <strong>JavaScript Functionality Testing:</strong> Interactive elements, AJAX requests, and DOM manipulations were tested to ensure proper functionality without page refreshes. <strong>User Acceptance Testing (UAT) Simulation:</strong> Role-based testing scenarios were conducted simulating the workflows of each user type (Admin, Stock Manager, Sales Staff) to validate system usability and feature completeness.</p>
            <h4 id="section11_4_3">4.4.3 Testing Results and Bug Fixes</h4>
            <p>The testing phases revealed several areas for improvement which were systematically addressed to enhance system reliability and user experience. <strong>Database Integrity Issues:</strong> Initial testing identified foreign key constraint violations during cascade deletions, resolved by implementing proper deletion handling and adding confirmation prompts for critical delete operations. <strong>Form Validation Enhancements:</strong> Client-side validation was strengthened to provide immediate feedback for invalid inputs, reducing server-side validation errors and improving user experience. <strong>Authentication Flow Improvements:</strong> Session management and redirect logic were refined to ensure proper user flow after login/logout operations. <strong>Inventory Logic Refinements:</strong> Stock validation algorithms were enhanced to prevent overselling and ensure accurate inventory tracking during concurrent order processing. <strong>UI/UX Polish:</strong> Visual consistency issues were resolved by standardizing Tailwind CSS classes, improving error message display, and enhancing responsive design for mobile devices. <strong>Performance Optimizations:</strong> Database queries were optimized using Django's select_related and prefetch_related to reduce query count and improve page load times. The iterative testing and debugging process resulted in a more robust, user-friendly system with improved data accuracy, better error handling, and enhanced overall performance. (Summarize outcomes, discuss significant bugs and resolutions).</p>

            <h3 id="section11_5">4.5 Process Mapping</h3>
            <h4 id="section11_5_1">4.5.1 System's Core Processes Visualization</h4>
            <p>The Spectre Clothing Management System's core processes have been comprehensively mapped and visualized through detailed process flow diagrams. The key processes include: (1) <strong>Product Management Process</strong> - from supplier information input through product creation, category assignment, image upload, to final catalog availability; (2) <strong>Inventory Management Process</strong> - covering variant creation (size/color combinations), stock assignment, inventory tracking, and automated alert generation; (3) <strong>Order Management Process</strong> - spanning customer information capture, product selection, stock validation, order creation, and fulfillment tracking; (4) <strong>Analytics & Reporting Process</strong> - encompassing data collection, performance analysis, visualization generation, and business insight delivery; (5) <strong>Dashboard Overview Process</strong> - real-time data aggregation, KPI calculation, alert generation, and executive summary presentation. These process maps are implemented as technical documentation in the system's documentation folder, providing clear visual representations of data flows, decision points, and system interactions. (Detailed process flow visualizations are available in the system's documentation at <a href="./process_flow_visualization.html"><code>documentation/process_flow_visualization.html</code></a> and technical mapping at <a href="./technical_process_mapping.md"><code>documentation/technical_process_mapping.md</code></a>. Include/refer to clear process maps, e.g., flowcharts, BPMN, UML activity diagrams in Appendices).</p>
            <h4 id="section11_5_2">4.5.2 Inputs, Outputs, Activities, and Decision Points</h4>
            <p>Each core process is structured with clearly defined components: <strong>Product Management:</strong> Inputs include supplier information, product specifications, categories, and images; Activities involve product registration, category assignment, supplier association, and image management; Decision points check SKU uniqueness, category existence, and supplier selection; Outputs produce cataloged products ready for variant creation. <strong>Inventory Management:</strong> Inputs comprise existing products, size/color options, and initial quantities; Activities include variant creation, stock assignment, and inventory tracking; Decision points validate combination uniqueness, quantity thresholds, and reorder levels; Outputs generate stocked variants, adjustment records, and stock alerts. <strong>Order Management:</strong> Inputs consist of customer information, product selections, and quantities; Activities encompass customer management, product selection, stock validation, and order creation; Decision points verify customer existence, stock availability, and quantity validity; Outputs create order records, customer history, and inventory adjustments. <strong>Analytics Process:</strong> Inputs include historical order data and time periods; Activities involve data aggregation, trend analysis, and visualization generation; Decision points determine sufficient data availability and analysis scope; Outputs deliver performance reports, dashboards, and business insights. Each process maintains comprehensive audit trails and supports the overall business workflow through seamless integration points. (For each process map, label start/end points, activities, decision nodes, inputs/outputs, and provide a descriptive narrative).</p>

            <h3 id="section11_6">4.6 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)</h3>
            <p>The Spectre Clothing Management System utilizes three core KPIs to evaluate operational efficiency, data accuracy, and technical performance. These KPIs are designed to provide measurable insights into system effectiveness and support continuous improvement initiatives that directly impact business operations and customer satisfaction. (Explain relevance of each KPI. For detailed definitions, see <a href="./kpi_definition.html">KPI Definitions</a>).</p>
            <h4>KPI 1: Order Fulfillment Efficiency</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> Measures the percentage of orders successfully processed from creation to completion within target timeframes. This KPI tracks the system's ability to handle the complete order lifecycle efficiently, from initial order placement through inventory validation, order processing, and final delivery confirmation.</li>
                <li><strong>Measurement Method:</strong> Calculated as (Orders Completed Within Target Time / Total Orders) × 100%. Data is collected from Django Order model timestamps tracking order status transitions (PENDING → PROCESSING → SHIPPED → DELIVERED). The system monitors completion times against established SLA targets for each order status phase. (The existing text for "Measurement Methods" from old section 11.2 can be integrated here or for other KPIs: "Order Fulfillment Efficiency is tracked through automated timestamp recording in the Order model, with Django signals triggering KPI calculations upon status changes. Real-time monitoring dashboards display current fulfillment rates and alert stakeholders to processing delays.")</li>
                <li><strong>Target Value:</strong> ≥ 95% for excellent performance, with acceptable performance at 85-94%. Orders should progress through all status phases within defined timeframes to meet customer expectations and operational efficiency goals.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>KPI 2: Inventory Accuracy Rate</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> Measures the percentage of product variants where system-recorded quantities match actual available stock levels. This KPI ensures data integrity in inventory management, preventing overselling, stockouts, and customer dissatisfaction caused by inaccurate inventory information.</li>
                <li><strong>Measurement Method:</strong> (Specify how it will be measured, e.g., "Utilizes the ProductVariant and InventoryAdjustment models to maintain audit trails of all stock movements, with weekly reconciliation processes comparing system quantities against actual stock levels. Calculated as (Accurate Variants / Total Variants Checked) x 100%.")</li>
                <li><strong>Target Value:</strong> (Specify desired value, e.g., "≥ 98% accuracy.")</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>KPI 3: System Performance Score (Example: User Task Completion Rate)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Description:</strong> (e.g., "Measures the percentage of users successfully completing a key task like order creation without errors or requiring support.")</li>
                <li><strong>Measurement Method:</strong> (e.g., "Monitored through user interaction logs, analytics on form submissions, or periodic usability testing. Calculated as (Successful Task Completions / Total Task Attempts) x 100%.") (The existing text for "Measurement Methods" from old section 11.2 can be integrated here: "System Performance Score combines multiple data sources including Django middleware for request timing, database query monitoring, and user interaction logging to calculate composite performance metrics.")</li>
                <li><strong>Target Value:</strong> (e.g., "≥ 95% successful task completion.")</li>
            </ul>
             <p>(Old section 11.2 text for context, to be integrated or removed: "KPI measurement is implemented through a comprehensive data collection framework integrated into the Django application. ... All KPI data is aggregated daily and reported weekly through the analytics dashboard, with automated alerts for metrics falling below target thresholds.")</p>
